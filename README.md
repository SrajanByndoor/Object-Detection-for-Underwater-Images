# SUIM Dataset â€“ Underwater Object Detection (In Progress)
This repository contains the early-stage development of an **object detection pipeline** based on the [SUIM (Segmented Underwater Image) dataset](https://irvlab.cs.umn.edu/resources/suim-dataset). The SUIM dataset is designed for semantic understanding of underwater scenes and provides pixel-level segmentation masks for a variety of underwater object classes.

---

## Objective

Build an object detection system for underwater images, with a pipeline that includes:

- Dataset loading and inspection
- Bounding box generation from segmentation masks
- Object detection model training (YOLO planned)
- Evaluation and visualization of results
- Adaptation to challenges unique to underwater imaging (e.g., color shift, turbidity)
